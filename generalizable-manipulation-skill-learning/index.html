                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>
                  The study of generalization has played an essential role in many application
                  domains of machine learning, such as image recognition, speech recognition,
                  natural language processing. Surprisingly, in common frameworks of policy
                  learning, e.g., reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL),
                  generalizablity has not received the same amount of attention.
                  Only until recently, efforts start to be made to tackle the
                  generalizable policy learning problem. For example, to achieve
                  task-level generalization, meta-RL optimizes fast adaptation
                  in unseen environments; to make the best use of past
                  experiences, offline RL learns an initial policy using
                  previously collected trajectories, and the initial policy may
                  be refined by an online RL process; to improve policy
                  robustness, domain randomization and data augmentation
                  techniques that were originally developed in computer vision
                  are also applied in visual reinforcement/imitation learning.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Manipulation skill learning is an application domain that
                  allows us to explore generalizability along the aforementioned
                  dimensions. For example, a non-generalizable robot
                  manipulation policy can only manipulate the same objects that
                  appeared in the training environments, while a generalizable
                  one would be able to successfully manipulate objects of
                  different colors, geometries, and physical properties unseen
                  during training; it may even be able to handle different
                  numbers of objects at test time (compositional generalizability). 
                </p>

                <p>
                  We firmly believe that it is a good timing to start the
                  discussion of generalizable policy learning in NeurIPS. The
                  workshop is designed to foster progress in this topic, in
                  particular, with a focus on manipulation skills because they
                  require complex reasoning involving visual appearance,
                  geometry, and physics. We envision that the workshop will
                  bring together interdisciplinary researchers from machine
                  learning, vision, and robotics to discuss the current and
                  future research of this topic.
