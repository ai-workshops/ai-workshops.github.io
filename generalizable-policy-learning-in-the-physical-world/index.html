                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>
                  Generalization is particularly important when <b>learning policies to interact with the physical world</b>. The spectrum of such policies is broad: the policies can be high-level, such as action plans that concern temporal dependencies and casualties of environment states; or low-level, such as object manipulation skills to transform objects that are rigid, articulated, soft, or even fluid.
                  In the physical world, an embodied agent can face a number of changing factors such as <b>physical parameters, action spaces, tasks, visual appearances of the scenes, geometry and topology of the objects</b>, etc. And many important real-world tasks involving generalizable policy learning, e.g., visual navigation, object manipulation, and autonomous driving. Therefore, learning generalizable policies is crucial to developing intelligent embodied agents in the real world. 
                </p>

                <!-- <p>
                  Though important, the field is very much under-explored in a systematic way. While the study of generalization has played an essential role in many application domains of machine learning (e.g., image recognition and natural language processing), it did not receive the same amount of attention in common frameworks of policy learning (e.g., reinforcement learning and imitation learning) at the early stage for reasons such as policy optimization is difficult and benchmark datasets are not quite ready yet. 
                </p> -->

                <!-- <p>
                  Learning generalizable policies in the physical world requires deep synergistic efforts across fields of <b>vision, learning, and robotics</b>, and poses many interesting research problems. <b>Recently, this field has started to attract much attention across disciplines</b>, with the maturity of policy optimization algorithms and emergence of training environments with diverse assets. 
                  For example, to achieve task-level generalization, meta-RL optimizes fast adaptation in unseen environments; to generalize past experience to new scenarios, offline RL learns an initial policy using previously collected trajectories, and the initial policy may be refined by an online RL process; to improve generalization over visual appearance, domain randomization and data augmentation techniques that were originally developed in computer vision are also applied in visual reinforcement/imitation learning. 
                  In addition, in this past year, we are witnessing new physical simulation environments with diverse assets for training and testing generalizabile policy learning algorithms.
                  Given the importance of this topic and the increasing attention attracted by it, we firmly believe that it is good timing to start the discussion of generalizable policy learning in ICLR, which is a pioneering conference which leads the trends of machine learning, especially applied machine learning research.
                </p> -->

                <p>
                  Learning generalizable policies in the physical world requires deep synergistic efforts across fields of <b>vision, learning, and robotics</b>, and poses many interesting research problems.
                  This workshop is designed to foster progress in generalizable policy learning, in particular, with <b>a focus on the tasks in the physical world</b>, such as visual navigation, object manipulation, and autonomous driving, because these real-world tasks require complex reasoning involving visual appearance, geometry, and physics. Technically, we expect to stimulate improvement in new directions such as:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Emergence of physical concepts driven by interaction</li>
                    <li>Physical concept-based policy making</li>
                    <li>3D learning for policy learning </li>
                    <li>Differentiable physics coupled with policy learning</li>
                    <li>...</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>


                <p>
                  Our main targeted participants are researchers interested in <b>applying learning methods to develop intelligent embodied agents in the physical world</b>. More specifically, target communities include, but are not limited to: 
                  <i>
                    robotics, reinforcement learning, learning from demonstrations, offline reinforcement learning, meta-learning, multi-task learning, 3D vision, computer vision, computer graphics, and physical simulation.
                  </i>
                </p>

                <p>
                  In affiliation to this workshop, we are also organizing the <a href="https://sapien.ucsd.edu/challenges/maniskill2021/">ManiSkill Challenge</a>, which focuses on learning to manipulate unseen objects in simulation with 3D visual inputs. We will announce winners and host winner presentations in this workshop.
